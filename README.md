Aim: To study and implement the concept of Stack in C++ using arrays and functions with operations such as PUSH, POP, and PEEK.

Software used: Vs Code

Theory: 

A stack is a linear data structure in C++ that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. Using arrays and functions, stack operations like PUSH (insert), POP (remove), and PEEK (view top element) can be implemented efficiently. The stack uses a `top` pointer to track the current position. Itâ€™s ideal for problems involving recursion, expression evaluation, and backtracking. Understanding stack logic strengthens grasp over memory management and control flow in algorithmic programming.


Syntax:

    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;

    #define SIZE 100  // Maximum size of stack

    class Stack {
    int arr[SIZE];
    int top;

    public:
    Stack() {
        top = -1;
    }

    // PUSH operation
    void push(int value) {
        if (top >= SIZE - 1)
            cout << "Stack Overflow\n";
        else
            arr[++top] = value;
    }

    // POP operation
    void pop() {
        if (top < 0)
            cout << "Stack Underflow\n";
        else
            top--;
    }

    // PEEK operation
    void peek() {
        if (top < 0)
            cout << "Stack is Empty\n";
        else
            cout << "Top element: " << arr[top] << endl;
    }

    // Display stack
    void display() {
        if (top < 0)
            cout << "Stack is Empty\n";
        else {
            cout << "Stack elements: ";
            for (int i = top; i >= 0; i--)
                cout << arr[i] << " ";
            cout << endl;
        }
    }
    };

    int main() {
    Stack s;
    s.push(10);
    s.push(20);
    s.peek();
    s.pop();
    s.display();

    return 0;
    }


Algorithm:

i) Algorithm: Stack Implementation Using Arrays in C++

 1. Define Stack Class
- Create a class `Stack` with:
  - An integer array `arr[SIZE]` to store stack elements.
  - An integer `top` to track the top index, initialized to -1.

 2. Implement Stack Operations
- `push(int value)`: Adds an element to the top if not full; else shows overflow.
- `pop()`: Removes the top element if not empty; else shows underflow.
- `display()`: Prints all elements from top to bottom.

 3. Menu-Driven Interface
- In `main()`, use a loop to present options:
  - 1 for push, 2 for pop, 3 for display, 0 to exit.

 4. Handle User Input
- Use `cin` to take user choice and value (for push).
- Call corresponding stack methods based on the choice.

 5. Exit Program
- Continue loop until user selects option 0.
- Display exit message and return 0 to end execution.

Conclusion:

This program demonstrates stack implementation in C++ using arrays and functions, reinforcing core operations like PUSH, POP, and DISPLAY. It highlights the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle and shows how to manage overflow and underflow conditions. Such structured logic builds a strong foundation for mastering data structures and algorithmic thinking.
